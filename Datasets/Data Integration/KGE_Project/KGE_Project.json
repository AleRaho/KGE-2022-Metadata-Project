How to manage these data and achieve more efficient sharing and utilization is a filed that many researchers are exploring, that is, to fulfill the integration of knowledge and data in specific, rather than leaving information be unorganized. This report focuses on integrating all the public transportation as well as sharing vehicles information within Trentino so that the more complete transport information system could help people make a better decision and save time or money as much as possible.
