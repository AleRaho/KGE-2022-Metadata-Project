STD_P_1,Smart Society / Smart University,"Move towards hybrid systems where people and machines tightly work together to build a smarter society. The vision is a new generation of Collective Adaptive Systems where humans and machines synergically complement each other and operate collectively to achieve their, possibly conflicting, goals, but which also exhibit an emergent behaviour that is in line with their designers’ objectives.","Empirical evidence has shown how students' time management ability and its consequent translation into time allocation between academic and other daily activities may have an impact on students' performance. Given their wide adoption among students, smartphones can help in understanding their behaviour and develop strategies for administrators and academic staff to enact policies that help students learn better strategies for managing their time and their academic workload. SmartUniversity is jointly developed by the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Sociology and Social Research of the University of Trento.
