This project resulted from the 2022/2023 Knowledge Graph Engineering class of Prof. Fausto Giunchiglia at UniTn. 

### Purpose and Domain of Interest
Our project context is an Open Data environment, where anyone is free to use, re-use or
redistribute resources - data or contents - while preserving provenance and openness.
Data Scientia is the concrete representation of this environment: an under-costruction
web portal that allows users to explore different kind of datasets.
Data Scientia’s main goal is to gather all projects that result from Knowl-
edge Graph Engineering (KGE) processes following the iTelos methodology
[link](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2105.09418). Each project can contain multiple datasets,
each belonging to a different informational layer. For each project, three main layers should be
identified:

• **Language Layer:** any linguistic resource - property or dataset about languages and terms
used - should be explicitly referenced to increase re-usability.

• **Knowledge Layer:** any Knowledge Base encoding information about KG schemas (etypes
and properties). If detailed enough, this layer could be decomposed in its core elements:
ontology and teleology, thus giving the user an unprecedented insight into the conceptual
and relational data shaping behind the actual data values representation.

• **Data layer:** any dataset which consists of data in some format, instantiating the KG’s struc-
ture (entities and attributes).

If users are interested in expanding data resources, they can
use the already existing schemas as meaningful anchors, without loosing data quality.
Data Scientia users should have access to both projects and their layers and decide what to
re-use, modify or produce to meet the purpose they have in mind. Projects should be linked
based on their similarities on a general and layered basis.
Metadata play a crucial role in this context because they describe datasets and repre-
sent the connections between them, making resources findable and addressable without any
effort. For example, users looking for healthcare ontologies should be able to access them
directly, without having to go through whole projects at the risk of stepping away from their
purpose. Metadata reduces search time and space: they allow users to skip to what is essential
to them, making the Data Scientia successful and meaningful.
Our project purpose can now be stated unambiguously:

*A KG supporting the Data Scientia web portal’s users to find the most suitable resource
for their needs, as well as all the resources linked by the one searched.*

To achieve the project objective, we have analyzed existing KGE Projects and Data Scientia resources and projects, which were our data resources. We have extracted the
fundamental layered view of datasets from KGE Projects and we have outlined Data Scientia main entity types, along with their properties, by carefully examining the web portal and through
a Data Scientia top level description and requirements given to us by the domain expert. The
latter helped us understanding the preliminary boundaries of our schema resources, by stating
the present structure of the portal with its shortcomings: the absence of linked resources and
informational layers. To overcome them, we have designed a possible and plausible future
structure for the Data Scientia web portal, by defining its Knowledge Graph.

In our [Project Report](https://github.com/AleRaho/KGE-2022-Metadata-Project/tree/main/Documentation), stored in the git repository as well, you will find a detailed step-by-step description in which we tried to explain why this topic is so important and impactfull and how we menaged to produce our KG using the iTelos metodology.
